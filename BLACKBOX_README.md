## README.md

This is a README.md file for a simple Python program. The program takes two numbers as input and prints their sum.

### Step 1: Import the `math` library

The `math` library contains a number of useful functions for mathematical calculations. We will use the `sum()` function to add the two numbers together.

```python
import math
```

### Step 2: Define the function

The function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

```python
def add(a, b):
  return a + b
```

### Step 3: Get the input from the user

The `input()` function asks the user to enter a value. We will use this function to get the two numbers from the user.

```python
a = input("Enter the first number: ")
b = input("Enter the second number: ")
```

### Step 4: Convert the input to numbers

The `input()` function returns a string. We need to convert the strings to numbers before we can add them together.

```python
a = int(a)
b = int(b)
```

### Step 5: Add the numbers together

Now that we have two numbers, we can add them together using the `add()` function.

```python
c = add(a, b)
```

### Step 6: Print the output

The `print()` function prints the output to the console.

```python
print("The sum of the two numbers is", c)
```

### Step 7: Run the program

To run the program, save the code in a file and then run the file in a Python interpreter.

```
python my_program.py
```

The program will ask you to enter two numbers. Enter the numbers and the program will print the sum of the two numbers.
